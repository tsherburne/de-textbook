The system includes a variety of sensors to locate and classify potential trespassers as either personnel or vehicles. An internal wireless communication system is used to support communication between the sensors and the operator, and also supports fire control communications between the operator and the obstacles. The sensors include obstacle-based seismic and acoustic sensors, infrared sensors and an unmanned aerial vehicle-based surveillance system to provide warning of potential adversaries approaching the protected area. The operator is located in a vehicle, and operates within visual range of the protected area. The operator is in communication with a higher-level command and control (C2) system for exchange of doctrinal-related and situation awareness information. A more detailed functional description of the system is presented below.\n",

        "* Obstacle Deployment: About 50 obstacles are available to be distributed over the 100-acre protected area (each obstacle is designed to protect a 300x300 foot area). Two types of obstacles can be deployed. One type of obstacle addresses anti-personnel requirements. It contains six (6) short-range sub-munitions, each covering a 60-degree portion of a circular area to be protected. The second type of obstacle contains a single munition capable of impacting a tracked vehicle. \n",

The UAV is used to provide warning information. The operator can relocate his or her vehicle for improved visual observation.\n",
        "* Obstacle design features: The obstacle-based sensors provide regular operator situation awareness reports (seconds apart) when they detect a trespasser. They provide, at a lower data rate (e.g., a minute apart), general health related information, including reports on their location (GPS-based), their on-off status, and their remaining battery life.  Should a weapon be fired, the obstacle confirms the acceptance of commands and the actual firing events. To address potential tampering risks, obstacle-based software can only be modified by electrically disconnecting their platform-based computer from the obstacle, and removal results in self-destruction of that computer. \n",
        "* Infrared sensor configuration: A single pole-mounted IR sensor is assumed to be capable of providing surveillance of the entire protected area. A second sensor is provided for redundancy, and can be used to provide surveillance of areas that the single sensor is not able to observe. The IR sensors provide the same type of operator situation awareness data at the same rates as the obstacle-based sensors, but in addition provide tracking information to enable the operator to project future locations of moving vehicles or people. \n",
        "* Requirements for Avoiding Errors: Concerns exist regarding detonating sub-munitions in cases where non-adversarial vehicles or people, by chance, enter the prohibited area. Concerns also exist about failing to fire munitions when an adversary is approaching a strategically sensitive location via the prohibited area. The operator, when possible, can use visual observations to increase confidence regarding fire control. \n",
        "* Operator Functions: The operator can set the obstacles into either on or off modes and can cause individual or designated groups of obstacles/sub-munitions to detonate when in on mode. Obstacles can be commanded to self-destroy designated critical information in order to prevent adversaries from collecting such information for their own purposes. The operator also can launch a quad-copter drone (UAV) to provide video/IR based early warning information regarding potential trespassers of the protected area  (~5 minute warning for vehicles approaching at a 10 mph speed). \n",
        "* Communications Systems: The Operator, the higher level C2 System, and UAV operate on a shared radio system that is integrated to a relay node(s) that couples into the Silverfish system’s integrated wireless communication network. The communication system includes digital interfaces that support formatted data transfers between the operator’s system, the UAV subsystem, the individual obstacles, the IR subsystem, and the C2 Center. The communication system also supports short message text and voice communications between operator and C2 system.\n",
        "* Operator Control Station: The operator is provided with a vehicle-mounted computer(s) subsystem that provides situation awareness information including individual obstacle status, and sensor-based situation awareness information. The subsystem also provides computer based entry and corresponding weapon system feedback for fire control related inputs from the operator. The control station also supports required digital situation awareness related reporting to the C2 center. \n",
        "* Command Center Controls: The C2 center digitally provides weapon control information for the operator (determines weapon system on/off periods, provides warning of periods of higher likelihood of attack, provides forecasts of possible approach direction to the prohibited area, enables operation with/without UAV support, etc.). As determined by either the operator or the C2 center, out of norm situations can be supported through rapid message communications between the C2 center and the operator. \n",
        "* Forensics: All subsystems collect and store forensic information for required post-mission analysis purposes. \n",
        "* Rapid Deployment Support: All subsystems enable rapid deployment testing to confirm readiness for operational use."
